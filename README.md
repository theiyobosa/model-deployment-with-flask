<h1>Model Deployment with Flask</h1>

This repo demonstrates how a simple model can be deployed on a server, on a local machine.

<h2>Repository</h2>

This repo contains an already built Linear Regression model, and uses <b>Flask</b> Python package for deployment.

It makes use of only three <b>very simple HTML</b> pages throughout the server. These HTML pages can be found in <b>flask_wrapper -> templates</b>.

The repo also contains two python files within <b>flask_wrapper</b>, one of them uses the model to predict, and the other one is the actual server.

The <b>run.py</b> file is used to initialize the server.
